**DATASET ANALYSIS FOR MACHINE LEARNING**

- Supervised ML: Implements various machine learning algorithms and techniques. The project covers topics such as linear and logistic regression, sigmoid functions, decision-boundaries, and feature scaling, for building efficient machine learning models.

- Dataset Analysis: Explores, parses and preprocesses various datasets using Pandas, then uses machine learning techniques and algorithms, (k-NN, Na√Øve Bayes, and SVM) with sci-kit learn, to visualize distributions of each feature for each class involved.
